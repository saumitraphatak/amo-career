# pages/tof-calculator.html

**Purpose:** "MOT Temperature" — ballistic expansion / time-of-flight thermometry.

## Flow
1. Page hero.
2. **5 numbered sections, no route-panel**: 01 Atom & Temperature (inputs) → 02 Cloud Expansion σ(t) (chart) → 03 Fit Temperature from Data (**real** σ² vs t² linear regression from a data table) → 04 Cooling Limit Reference → 05 References.

## Review outcome: approved, no changes
Clean linear calculator flow: set up → visualize → fit real data → contextualize against physical limits → references. Confirmed section 03's "Fit Temperature from Data" is a genuine linear-regression fit (unlike release-recapture.html's phantom fitting claim — this page actually does what it says).


## Accessibility audit update (2026-09)
Converted the `.page-wrap` skip-link target to a real `<main>` landmark; added `scope="col"` to 4 table column headers; wired `for=`/`id` on 7 label/input pairs; added `aria-hidden="true"` to 3 decorative accordion-chevron icons. See docs/accessibility-audit-2026-09.md.


## Navigation/IA audit update (2026-09)
A JS bug (`initRelatedToolsPanel()`'s "already exists" guard checked for its own `.auto-related-tools` class instead of any existing `.see-also` section) was auto-injecting a second, often-contradictory "Related tools" panel right before this page's hand-written "See Also" section on every load. Fixed the guard so the auto-panel only fires when no related-tools section exists yet — this page's own hand-curated See Also block is unaffected and is now the only one shown. See docs/navigation-audit-2026-09.md.


## Performance audit update (2026-09)
Added a `<link rel="preconnect" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net" crossorigin>` hint next to the existing font preconnects — this page loads KaTeX and/or Chart.js from jsdelivr with no early connection hint before this fix. See docs/performance-audit-2026-09.md.


## Design/visual-consistency audit update (2026-09-17)
This page's `<style>` block used `var(--mono)` for 6 monospace-styled rules — `--mono` was never defined anywhere in the codebase (only `--font-mono` exists in `css/styles.css`), so with no fallback these elements silently inherited the page's body font instead of rendering in the mono typeface. Replaced all 6 with `var(--font-mono)`. See docs/design-audit-2026-09-17.md.

## Cross-page consistency re-audit (2026-09-18)
`BreadcrumbList` JSON-LD named this page's category "Measure & Cool" (the category's pre-rename name), while the hero eyebrow and NAV dropdown already said "Trap, Image & Cool." Corrected the breadcrumb to match. See docs/cross-page-consistency-audit-2026-09-18.md.


## Content-flow & pedagogy audit update (2026-09-19)
Cross-reference naming drift: this page's own outgoing "See Also" card label(s) used a stale, pre-rename name for one or more target/self pages (the site has renamed several pages more than once over its history; og/twitter/JSON-LD headline were already synced by the 2026-09-16 technical audit and the breadcrumb *category* name by the 2026-09-18 cross-page-consistency audit, but these three other copies of a page's name were not). Synced to each page's current `<title>`. See docs/flow-audit-2026-09-19.md.
